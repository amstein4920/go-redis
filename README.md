An ongoing project to follow the steps set by CodeCrafters to create a Redis clone in Go. The service essentially provides the requirements and the test suite, code is not written by anybody other than me.

This is my first "substantial" project and Go and is serves no practical purpose beyond my own education. Nevertheless, it is indicative of the current quality of my coding in Go specifically.
